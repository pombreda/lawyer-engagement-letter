To the board of directors of Sudo Room:

I was very glad to meet with April, Julio, and Max on December 17. It was clear both before, but especially after, our meeting that Sudo Room has attracted some very energetic and capable people, for all the right reasons.

During that meeting, we discussed my becoming Sudo Room's attorney, to help the organization set itself up from a legal point of view, guide the group through the process of obtaining recognized non-profit and tax-exempt status, and to field any legal questions related to organization or the business side of running Sudo Room that may come up in the future. I would be delighted to help Sudo Room in this way.

Once signed, this letter will be a legally binding agreement---a contract---between Sudo Room and I. To be clear, I am not Sudo Room's lawyer until Sudo Room has signed and delivered this letter or one like it to me.

It is almost always best to get the details of that kind of relationship down on paper up-front in a way that everyone understands. To that end, I've done my best to write this letter clearly, with a minimum of "legalese." If any part of this letter isn't clear, please let me know; we should make it clear. Of course, if any questions come up later, you should also let me know as soon as possible.

We have also discussed making the content of this letter publicly available for review and discussion, in Sudo Room room's typically transparent way. While reviewing a letter like this in the open is a might unusual, I understand how important transparency is to Sudo Room's mission and community. Please feel free to distribute this letter for review by all Sudo Room's members, online and otherwise.

If the terms of this letter are understood acceptable, please authorize an officer to sign and return it to me on behalf of Sudo Room. I will officially be Sudo Room's lawyer when I receive the signed letter.

Our terms are as follows:

I commit to represent the organization, Sudo Room, but not any board member, officer, member, or other individual related to the organization. In other words, this letter will make me Sudo Room's lawyer, for the organization as a whole, but not any individual's lawyer. I will represent Sudo Room in matters related to legal organization, governance, compliance, and business.

From time to time I may want to use outside help to do legal work more efficiently or effectively. I may use other lawyers or non-lawyer staff to help me represent Sudo Room.

Regardless, the legal services and advice I provide will only be as useful and valuable as the information provided to me is complete, accurate, and up-to-date. Sudo Room will do its part to provide me good information when I need it.

It is my intent to provide legal services to Sudo Room free of charge, as a service to our community and the public. That being said, Sudo Room may have future legal needs that are different from or greater than what I can provide competently or at my own expense. I will let Sudo Room know as soon as possible whenever this is the case, and I will never bill Sudo Room any amount for professional services without a separate agreement spelling out an hourly rate or other way of calculating fees ahead of time.

In providing legal services, I may have expenses, like filing fees or document fees. I will let Sudo Room know when I expect to incur an expense, and Sudo Room will reimburse me for expenses that it approves in advance. I won't have to pay any expenses for Sudo Room that Sudo Room doesn't agree to pay.

Lawyers are subject to rules, called "conflict of interest" rules for short, that prevent them from representing clients with certain kinds of competing interests, especially when the lawyers may have received confidential information from one client that's useful to another. I have checked my records and concluded that representing Sudo Room won't cause any conflict-of-interest problem under the rules governing California attorneys like me. That being said, if I discover a conflict in the future, Sudo Room will assist, within reason, to help me resolve the conflict to the satisfaction of everyone involved. As a general matter, Sudo Room will not prevent me from representing other clients that may compete with Sudo Room or perform similar activities to Sudo Room's.

Sudo Room can end our attorney-client relationship at any time, and I reserve the right to stop work on any legal matter at any time. I can withdraw from our attorney-client relationship when doing so won't have a significant negative effect on Sudo Room, or when necessary to avoid ethical issues. Otherwise, I'll need Sudo Room's consent to withdraw.

If we decide to change these terms in the future, we will write out the changes and sign them. No other changes will count.

Please feel free to phone me at 415-864-9913 if you have any questions. It will be my honor to help stand Sudo Room up as a pillar of our community.

Sincerely,

Kyle Mitchell
Attorney at Law
